First install the original firmware from A-Sure. Don't forget to rename the 5009_20.zip to 5009_60.zip.
Put everything from the original file in the root of a USB stick

When everything is ready, install ADB over Wifi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=za.co.henry.hsu.adbwirelessbyhenry)
Connect the car head unit (HU) and a Linux/Windows laptop to the same network. And install adb tools.

I have some troubles with my E1750 4G stick. It won't recognised by the Android device. I had installed PPP Widget, but it not always run good.
So I have to change the cd-rom capability of the Huawei E1750.

Huawei E1750 Android fix
On a Linux computer install the screen application (yum install screen of apt-get install screen)
Login as root and do the following: (where ttyUSB0 is the name of the Huawei E1750 stick)

# screen /dev/ttyUSB0

AT^U2DIAG=0^M
